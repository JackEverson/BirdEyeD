# Model 00
This is the first trained model to be deployed. This model will be trained from an online data set. Once a model has been trained in this way it can be used to begin collecting data for a model that I can then build from scratch (or even just to reinforce this model).
This model was constructed following the PyTorch tutorial found at:
