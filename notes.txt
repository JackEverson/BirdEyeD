# process for setup

## installing OpenCV
There is a guide available online at https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html but I am intending to make a script that automates this process. Below is the general guide followed to install into Ubuntu:

1) Downloading
# Install minimal prerequisites 
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y cmake g++ wget unzip
# Download and unpack sources (26FEB2023)
wget -O opencv.zip https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/4.x.zip
unzip opencv.zip
# Create build directory
mkdir -p build && cd build
# Configure
cmake  ../opencv-4.x
# Build
cmake --build .

make -j4
sudo make install

After successful build you will find libraries in the build/lib directory and executables (test, samples, apps) in the build/bin directory:
ls bin
ls lib

CMake package files will be located in the build root:
ls OpenCVConfig*.cmake
ls OpenCVModules.cmake
