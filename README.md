# Bird_eyeD

This is a project aimed at setting up an machine learning wildlife camera that can identify birds. The project will be set up in several stages, I envision it to go in the following manner:

1) Setup a Raspberry Pi 4 with a camera and utilise an open source AI to identify animals.
2) Adapt the working code so that when the AI recognises a bird it will take a photo of it and store the picture for later viewing.
3) Adapt and train the AI further so that it can begin to recognise species of birds. 
4) +? Using a stockpile of labeled photos attempt to create and train my own AI (This will likely be for the experience rather than a performance improvement)



(I suspect I will be following core electronics 'object recognition guide with OpenCV' to begin with: https://core-electronics.com.au/guides/object-identify-raspberry-pi/ and https://core-electronics.com.au/projects/backyard-birdcam/)
