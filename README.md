# Bird eyeD

This is a simple machine learning project that is being setup to collect photos of birds. The intention is to use a predefined model (for example MobileNet v2) or to train a model with a already existing data set (for example cifar10) that can generally recognise birds. From there I will set up a Raspberry Pi with a camera to collect bird photo's. These photo's will then be used to train a new network that can begin to recognise species of birds more specifically.
